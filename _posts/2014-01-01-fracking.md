Fracking is at the forefront of the climate change debate
at the moment, as it literally shoves the issue into your face,
especially if you happen to live near a rig. This is likely to
become increasingly common, with many proposed and granted sites in the
pipeline (see map [here](http://frack-off.org.uk/locations/)).
Of course, the industry says it has the best of intentions, and that
fracking is actually *beneficial* for the climate, as it emits less
carbon dioxide than coal. The problem is *fugitive emissions*:
because methane is such a potent greenhouse gas, if even a small quantity
leaks into the atmosphere - [around 3%](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2013/oct/24/dame-helen-ghosh-fracking-wind-turbines-national-trust) -
shale gas is worse than coal. This finding is neatly illustrated in
a figure published in a visualisation from a debate in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7364/abs/477271a.htmli).
